# Data Science Tools Project: Happiness Index Report Analysis - Happiness Index and Population Well-being Alignment Exploration Across Europe
## Project Overview: 
Led a comprehensive analysis of global and European happiness dynamics using the Happiness Index Data Set and European Social Survey Data Set. Explored factors influencing happiness and developed predictive models to forecast happiness scores. Conducted a comparative analysis to evaluate the alignment between happiness indices and subjective well-being across Europe.

## Key Methodologies: 
### Data Collection & Preprocessing: 
- Collected and cleaned data from multiple sources including the World Happiness Report, World Development Indicators, and European Social Survey.

- Merged datasets using advanced data wrangling techniques to create a unified data set for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
- Visualized global happiness trends over time using geographic and statistical methods.

- Analyzed the correlation between happiness scores and various factors such as GDP, social support, and freedom.

### Predictive Modeling: 
Developed and compared multiple regression models to predict happiness scores:

- **Traditional Model (TM):** Achieved an R² value of 0.77, demonstrating a strong correlation between happiness and variables like GDP and social support.

- **Logarithmic Transformation Model (TMln):** Achieved a slightly lower R² (0.75) but improved accuracy with an RMSE of 0.54.

- **Principal Component Analysis Model (PCA):** Explained 76.9% of variance with a comparative RMSE of 0.55, showcasing advanced dimensionality reduction techniques.

### Advanced Statistical Analysis:
- Performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify key components influencing happiness.

- Evaluated the European Social Survey data for consistency with the Happiness Index, revealing a low standard deviation (0.49) indicating reliable alignment of happiness measures.

### Data Visualization:
Created insightful visualizations including:

- **Happiness Score Map:** Illustrated global happiness trends.

- **PCA Visualization:** Showcased relationships between happiness indicators and regional differences.

- **Correlation Matrix:** Revealed complex interrelationships between happiness-related variables.

## Tools & Technical Skills:
- **Programming Languages:** Python, R

- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn

- **Techniques:** Exploratory Data Analysis, Principal Component Analysis, Logarithmic Transformation, Linear Regression, Data Visualization

- **Statistical Methods:** Correlation Analysis, Predictive Modeling, Dimensionality Reduction

## Key Achievements: 
- **Uncovered Key Insights:** Identified primary factors influencing happiness and highlighted that high GDP alone does not guarantee high happiness.

- **Innovative Modeling:** Developed and tested multiple predictive models, demonstrating the ability to apply both traditional and advanced statistical techniques.

- **European Context Analysis:** Successfully bridged data from international and European contexts to explore subjective well-being and happiness measures.

## Impact: 
The project demonstrated my ability to tackle complex data science problems, employ advanced analytical techniques, and derive actionable insights from large datasets. My work highlighted the multifaceted nature of happiness and provided a robust framework for future research and practical applications in the field of data science.
